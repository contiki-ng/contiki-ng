# 6tisch/custom-schedule

This example shows how to manually add cells in the TSCH schedule.

The intention of this example is instead to serve a starting point for those
interested in building their own schedules for TSCH that are different from
the ones provided by Contiki-NG (currently Orchestra and the 6TiSCH minimal).

Be aware that this is not an example how to design a *good* schedule for TSCH,
nor this is the right place for complete beginners in TSCH.
We recommend using the default Orchestra schedule as a starting point for that.
