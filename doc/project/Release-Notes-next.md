## API changes for ports outside the main tree

### Centralized clock_time_t definition

Ports should now define `CLOCK_CONF_SIZE` instead of a typedef for `clock_time_t`
([#2550](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2550)).

This is similar to how `RTIMER_CONF_CLOCK_SIZE` is already handled.

## Cooja API changes for plugins outside the main tree
