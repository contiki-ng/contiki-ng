/**
 * \brief Block 1 support within a CoAP resource.
 *
 *        This function will help you to use block 1. If the target
 *        parameter is \p NULL, then error handling and response
 *        configuration is active.
 *
 *        You can find an example in
 *        examples/coap/coap-example-server/resources/res-b1-sep-b2.c
 *
 * \param request Request pointer from the handler.
 *
 * \param response Response pointer from the handler.
 *
 * \param target Pointer to the buffer where the request payload can
 * be assembled.
 *
 * \param len Pointer to the variable where the function stores the
 * actual length.
 *
 * \param max_len Length of the \p target buffer.
 *
 * \return 0 if the initialisation was successful,
 *         1 if more blocks will follow, or
 *         -1 if the initialisation failed.
