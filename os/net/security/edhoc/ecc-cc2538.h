 * \param curve The ECC curve being used for the operation

 *
 * This function performs ECC point multiplication using the provided public point coordinates (gx, gy)
 * and the private key. The result is used to generate the IKM, which is stored in the output buffer.
 * The function uses the CC2538 hardware for ECC operations and relies on the NIST P-256 curve for the calculations.
