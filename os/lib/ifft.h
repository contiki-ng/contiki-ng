/* ifft(xre[], n) - integer (fixpoint) version of Fast Fourier Transform
   An integer version of FFT that takes in-samples in an int16_t array
   and does an fft on n samples in the array.
   The result of the FFT is stored in the same array as the samples
   was stored.

   Note: This fft is designed to be used with 8 bit values (e.g. not
   16 bit values). The reason for the int16_t array is for keeping some
   'room' for the calculations. It is also designed for doing fairly small
   FFT:s since to large sample arrays might cause it to overflow during
   calculations.
