/* ifft(xre[], n) - integer (fixpoint) version of Fast Fourier Transform
   An integer version of FFT that takes in-samples in an int16_t array
   and does an fft on n samples in the array.
   The result of the FFT is stored in the same array as the samples
   was stored. Them imaginary part of the result is stored in xim which
   needs to be of the same size as xre (e.g. n ints).

   Note: This fft is designed to be used with 8 bit values (e.g. not
   16 bit values). The reason for the int16_t array is for keeping some
   'room' for the calculations. It is also designed for doing fairly small
   FFT:s since to large sample arrays might cause it to overflow during
   calculations.
