/**
 * \brief This function will feed the CSPRNG with a new seed.
 * \return A boolean indicating whether the operation succeeded.
 *
 *        Many manuals of radio chips from Texas Instruments suggest using I/Q
 *        data (Cartesian representations of the received signal) for
 *        generating true random numbers. This function follows this suggestion
 *        and extracts seeds from I/Q data. However, since those manuals state
 *        that I/Q data is not uniformly distributed, this function does not use
 *        I/Q data directly as seeds, but first applies an extractor function.
 *        Note that this function can only be called at start up.
