/**
 * \defgroup leds LED Hardware Abstraction Layer
 *
 * The LED HAL provides a set of functions that can manipulate LEDS.
 *
 * Currently, the LED HAL supports two APIs:
 *
 * - The new, platform-independent API (recommended for all new platforms).
 * - The legacy API (supported until all existing platforms have been ported
 *   to support the new API).
 *
 * The two APIs use very similar semantics and have an overlapping set of
 * function calls. This is done so that platform-independent examples can
 * work on all platforms, irrespective of which API each platform supports.
 *
 * The legacy API can be enabled by the platform code by defining
 * LEDS_CONF_LEGACY_API 1.
 *
 * Once all platforms supported in contiki-ng/contiki-ng have been ported to
 * the new API, the legacy API will be deleted without warning. For this
 * reason, it is strongly recommended to use the new API for new platforms and
 * for platforms hosted in external repositories.
 *
 * The new API provides a set of common LED manipulation functions that can be
 * used in a platform-independent fashion. Functions exist to manipulate one
 * LED at a time (\c leds_single_XYZ), as well as to manipulate multiple LEDs
 * at a time (\c leds_XYZ).
 *
 * The assumption is that each LED is connected to a GPIO pin using either
 * positive or negative logic.
 *
 * LEDs on a device are numbered incrementally, starting from 0 and counting
 * upwards. Thus, if a device has 3 LEDs they will be numbered 0, 1 and 2.
 * Convenience macros (LEDS_LED_n) are provided to refer to LEDs. These macros
 * can be used as arguments to functions that manipulate a single LED, such
 * as leds_single_on() but \e not leds_on().
 *
 * The legacy scheme that uses colours to refer to LEDs is maintained, without
 * semantic changes, but with minor changes in logic:
 *
 * - Firstly, we now define 5 LED colours: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange.
 *   These are sufficient to cover all currently-supported platforms.
 * - Secondly, unless a platform specifies that a LED of a specific colour
 *   exists, the HAL will assume that it does not.
 * - Trying to manipulate a non-existent LED will not cause build errors, but
 *   will not cause any changes to LED state either.
 * - We no longer map non-existing LED colours to existing ones.
 *
 * Note that, in order to avoid changes to LED colour semantics between the
 * two APIs, references to LED by colour are bitwise OR masks and should
 * therefore only be used as argument to functions that manipulate multiple
 * LEDS (e.g. leds_off() and \e not leds_single_off()).
 *
 * In terms of porting for new platforms, developers simply have to:
 *
 * - Define variables of type leds_t to represent their platform's LEDs
 * - Specify the number of LEDs on their device by defining LEDS_CONF_COUNT
 * - Map red colours to numbers (e.g. \#define LEDS_CONF_RED 1)
 *
 * \file
 *     Header file for the LED HAL
