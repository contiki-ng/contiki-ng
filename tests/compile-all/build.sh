# This file builds all examples for all platforms, excluding just those
# example and platform combinations that are marked as impossible in the Makefiles
# by using PLATFORMS_EXCLUDE and PLATFORMS_ONLY variables.
#
# To build with gmake and 8 cores, invoke with:
# MAKE="gmake" MAKEFLAGS="-j8" ./build.sh all
#
# This script can also clean all targets. To do that, run:
# ./build.sh clean
#
# To invoke the building for a specific platform, run:
# $ PLATFORMS=zoul ./build.sh
