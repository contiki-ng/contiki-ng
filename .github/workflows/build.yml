# Main Contiki-NG CI workflow
# Comprises a matrix-generated set of jobs that execute our CI test suite
name: CI

# Run the workflow on:
#   * Any PR against master, develop or candidate release branch
#   * Any push (or merge) on master and develop
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, develop, release-* ]

# We use a single job with a matrix with elements corresponding to our tests
# The job will be replicated as many times as there are elements in the matrix
jobs:
